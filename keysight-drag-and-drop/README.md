# Drag and Drop Icons

Drag and Drop Icons is a simple example of HTML5 Drag and Drop.

## Usage

Open `index.html` with a browser

## Instructions
### Objective
Create a HTML5 page using a JS framework or other tools of your choosing (for example AngularJS,
Angular2, React, etc.) to serve as a visual tool for creating an "expression." Note that you're not required
to use any particular framework.

### Inputs:
A list of JavaScript functions (for the purposes of this exercise you can assume that the list will be
complete and available when the page loads and will not change).

### Initial Display:
For every function in the list, a unique icon will be displayed on screen, captioned with the function
name. Additionally, a blank "expression area" will be present on the screen into which the user can drag
and drop the name icons

### Initial user interaction:
The user can drag and drop one of the icons into the blank "expression area". This will trigger additional
placeholder areas (a simple `<div>` with boundary) to appear on the right of the icon. The number of
placeholder areas is dependent on the number of arguments that the function represented by the icon
is supposed to receive.

### Advanced Extension (Extra Credit):
The user can drag more function icons into the new placeholder areas created by dropping of the
previous icon. This process can continue recursively indefinitely to create complex chained expressions
